## Inspiration

During the covid-19 pandemic I began cooking more. I started making a couple dishes that my family has already made. 2021 was coming and I was asked by my uncle what my New Year resolution was going to be. He knew I started to cook as I was previously learning dishes from him and his wife. I didn't have one in mind when he asked. When thinking, he brought up why don't I learn how to make one dish every month. I loved that idea and agreed to make that my new year resolution.

Ok so what dishes can I make I asked myself. So naturally I went online to find some dishes I can make... Website after website I visited to find the recipe I wanted to make. It was really hard to find inspiration just searching online, even on the blog posts I found they were trying to tell me a story rather than saying the difficulty of the dish, the ingredients I needed and how to make it. If there was only an app that helped me find inspiration and be super direct on how to make it and what i needed. OK so Instagram and Tiktok. Lots of great posts on Instagram but no recipe... tik tok is great for videos but a little too fast for me to follow. I need something with checkboxes and numbers.

## Purpose

Recipegram has a flavor of social media to find inspiration (like how you can scroll on Instagram to find fits to wear, how to pose models, or anything inspiration related) while providing information like a blog. (step by step instructions). Just post an image, a title of your dish, the ingredient list, and the directions of how to make it. Simple yet informative.

## Features I want to add:

- [ ] how long it takes (duration)
- [ ] user stories
- [ ] integrate embeded videos
  - [ ] choose the media they want to post. If they want to post a video, they need to embed their video link for example from youtube
  - it accepts any media right now, but it would be better to have embeded videos rather than
